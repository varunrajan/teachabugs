# teachabugs

This is a repository that contains user-reported issues as submitted via the Customer Care team via live chat ([using the Intercom GitHub integration](https://www.intercom.com/)) or email ([using Front's GitHub integration](https://frontapp.com/integrations/github)).

Similar issues will be aggregated and tracked on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/I6mHxbGC/teachabugs). The Technical Project Manager and engineers will follow up for further details on each individual issue.

Each Customer Care rep is responsible for testing resolved issues once a card attached to an issue is moved into the "Accepted" column. Please test the issue at that point, notify the customer that the issue is resolved, and close the issue. If the issue is not resolved, please comment on the issue accordingly.
